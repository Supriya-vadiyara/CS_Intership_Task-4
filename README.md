# Task 4: Windows Firewall Configuration Report

This report documents the process of configuring and testing the `Windows Defender Firewall` to control network traffic on a local machine. The objective was to add and test a rule to demonstrate basic firewall management skills.

---

### **1. Objective**

To use the **Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security** tool to create a new inbound rule that blocks traffic on a specific port, and then to test that the rule is working correctly.

---

### **2. Tools and Environment**

*   **Operating System:** `Microsoft Windows`
*   **Tool:** `Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security`
*   **Testing Utility:** `PowerShell` (using the `Test-NetConnection` cmdlet)

---

### **3. Process and Execution**

The following steps were performed to complete the task.

#### **Step 1: Listing Current Firewall Rules**

I began by opening the `Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security` tool and navigating to the **"Inbound Rules"** section. This provided a complete list of all currently active and inactive rules on the system, showing what applications and services are allowed or denied access.

#### **Step 2: Creating a New Rule to Block Telnet (Port 23)**

Next, I created a new inbound rule specifically to block traffic for the `Telnet` service, which operates on `TCP port 23`.

*   **Action:** In the "New Inbound Rule Wizard," I specified the rule type as `Port`.
*   **Protocol and Port:** I set the protocol to `TCP` and the specific port to `23`.
*   **Rule Action:** I selected **`Block the connection`**.
*   **Name:** I named the rule **`Blocked Telnet`** for easy identification.

The new rule was successfully added and appeared at the top of the inbound rules list, as shown in the screenshot below.

#### **Step 3: Testing the Firewall Rule**

With the "Block" rule active, the final step was to test if it was actually working. I used the `Test-NetConnection` command in PowerShell to attempt a connection to port 23 on my own machine (`localhost`).

*   **Command Executed:**
    ```powershell
    Test-NetConnection -ComputerName localhost -Port 23
    ```

*   **Result:** The connection attempt **failed**, with the output showing `TcpTestSucceeded: False`. This result confirms that the firewall rule is working exactly as intendedâ€”it successfully identified and blocked the traffic destined for port 23.

The screenshot below shows the command and its failed result, providing clear evidence of a successful firewall block.

#### **Step 4: Cleanup**

After the successful test, the `Blocked Telnet` rule was deleted from the firewall to restore the system to its original state.

### **4. Conclusion**

This task provided practical, hands-on experience with a fundamental cybersecurity tool. The process demonstrated how a firewall acts as a gatekeeper for network traffic. By creating a specific rule to block `TCP port 23`, I was able to prevent connections to that port, which was verified using a PowerShell test command.

This exercise highlights how firewalls are essential for reducing a system's "attack surface" by allowing administrators to enforce policies on what traffic is permitted and what is denied, thereby protecting the system from unwanted access.
